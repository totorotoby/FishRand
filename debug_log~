check multiple zooplankton:

easly done

Fix shapely error:

This may have something to do with the points phil input.
In actually shapely modulual. Look at map before assuming anything.

Fix hotspots inside outside error:

idea is that it is only crashing when hotspot is completely inside of region or hotspot is entire region. Need replicate code written on phils computer plus more

Fix prior chemical con error:

##unknown probably has to do with chemical not seen yet in area or definitely a prior concentration bug.
MOST likely hypothesis is that this is crashing because we were putting regions outside of the boundary without realizing it by making regions square.
