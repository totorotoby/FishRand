check multiple zooplankton:

easly done.

Fix hotspots inside outside error:

idea is that it is only crashing when hotspot is completely inside of region or hotspot is entire region. Need replicate code written on phils computer plus more

Fix prior chemical con error (potentially solved 1/8/2018):

##unknown probably has to do with chemical not seen yet in area or definitely a prior concentration bug.

problem was when there has been to taking in of chemical in regions for lower down fish prey of an apex predator, chemical cons aren't initiziled to 0 when they should be. Attempted fix at Bioaccum: 663.
