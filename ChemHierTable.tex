$C_{wp}$ is Concentration in Pore Water

$C_{wd}$ is Dissolved Concentration in Water

$C_{wt}$ is Total Concentration in Water

$C_{s}$ is Concentration in Sediment

The prefix ``est'' means that concentration is estimated

** in cases like this one $C_{wp}$ is used for uptake from water

and $C_{s}$ is exclusively for uptake from the diet.

General ``Hierarchical'' rules for concenrations used:

\begin{itemize}
\item entered $C_{wp}$, and entered $C_{wd}$ will always be used over entered $C_{wt}$ and entered $C_{s}$ in the uptake from water term, unless there is no  $C_{wp}$ and/or $C_{wd}$, then equations 4 or 11 in Arnot will be used to find either of them (see row 2).
\item If $C_s$ is entered it will be used no matter what for uptake from eating sediment. If it is not entered equation 11 will used for uptake from eating sediment (see row 3, and row 7).

\end{itemize}
